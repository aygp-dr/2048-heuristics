Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Completed systematic cleanup of project structure for 0.1.0 release
- Prioritized removing confusion from duplicate files
- Added comprehensive release documentation and metadata
- Established clear project organization standards

Debugging/Issues:
- Found duplicate 2048-heuristics.scm files with root version being current
- Confirmed outdated src version still had unconditional demo execution
- Verified run-analysis.sh was redundant with working bin/run-analysis

Cleanup performed:
- Removed outdated duplicate files (src/2048-heuristics.scm, run-analysis.sh)
- Created VERSION file marking 0.1.0 milestone
- Added comprehensive CHANGELOG.md documenting all features since initial commit
- Created detailed INSTALL.md with platform-specific instructions
- Verified all tests still pass after cleanup (42/42 tests passing)

Technical decisions:
- Kept root 2048-heuristics.scm as canonical version (has fixes)
- Maintained working bin/ scripts over shell script duplicates
- Used semantic versioning for 0.1.0 release
- Documented both technical and research achievements in changelog

Future improvements:
- Still need to validate analysis scripts work correctly
- Could add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Documentation could be further consolidated
- Examples directory could be added for clear usage demonstrations
