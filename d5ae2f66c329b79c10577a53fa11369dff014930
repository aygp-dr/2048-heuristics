Context:
- User requested development environment setup for Scheme code interaction
- Added support for Geiser, Guile3, Org mode, Tramp, and Paredit
- Created named tmux session management for project-specific Emacs configuration

Considerations:
- Ensured compatibility with existing project structure
- Made environment variables available in both .envrc and Makefile
- Provided flexible session naming with PROJECT_NAME as default
- Added comprehensive error checking and user-friendly messages

Technical Details:
- Emacs configuration loads required packages automatically
- Tmux session creates 4 windows: emacs, repl, shell, tests
- Main window split into code editor (60%) and Guile listener (40%)
- Script provides TTY information for potential remote access

Implementation Notes:
- Used conventional commit format without 'generated with' in body
- Added co-author attribution via --trailer flag
- Maintained consistency with existing Makefile style and conventions
